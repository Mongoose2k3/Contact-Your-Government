Sample letter to State Representatives/Senators:
My name is [YOUR FIRST & LAST NAME], I'm a [CONSTITUENT / SUPPORTER] of [SENATOR/REPRESENTATIVE NAME], and I’m calling about Palestine and Israel.

[YOUR KIND GREETING] 

For Representatives: [REPRESENTATIVE NAME] must publicly call for a ceasefire, pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and vote NO on sending more weapons for this war. A “humanitarian pause” is not good enough. They should cosponsor the ceasefire resolution, House Resolution 786, introduced by Representatives Cori Bush and Rashida Tlaib.

For Senators: [SENATOR NAME] must publicly call for a ceasefire, pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and vote NO on sending more weapons for this war. A “humanitarian pause” is not good enough. They should introduce a Senate Resolution calling for a ceasefire, similar to the one in the House.
